PDF Search Plus is a powerful Python application that processes PDF files by extracting text from pages and images, applying OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to images, and storing the results in a SQLite database. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to search and preview the PDF content, including OCR-extracted text.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

**Python Version**: This application requires Python 3.8 or higher. It has been tested and confirmed to work with Python 3.8 through 3.13.

You can check your Python version with:
```bash
python --version
```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ap6pack/PDF-Search-Plus.git
   cd PDF-Search-Plus
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Tesseract OCR Installation

The application requires the Tesseract OCR command-line tool to be installed on your system:

- On Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
  ```
- On macOS (using Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install tesseract
  ```
- On Windows:
  Download and install from [Tesseract OCR for Windows](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).

Ensure that the `tesseract` command is in your system's PATH. The application calls this command directly rather than using a Python wrapper.

## Python Dependencies

All Python dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file and should be installed as mentioned in the Installation section above.

### Dependency Conflicts

When installing the requirements, you may encounter dependency conflicts, particularly with numpy versions. If you see errors related to numpy version conflicts (e.g., with packages like thinc or spacy), you may need to uninstall the conflicting packages:

```bash
pip uninstall -y thinc spacy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This is because the application requires numpy<2.0 for compatibility with pandas 2.2.0, which may conflict with other packages that require numpy>=2.0.0.

## Usage

### Running the Application

The application is designed to be simple to use. Just run the main script and everything will be set up automatically:

```bash
python run_pdf_search.py
```

The database will be automatically created or validated when you run the application. No separate setup steps are required.

**Note:** If you need to recreate the database from scratch (e.g., after schema changes or corruption), you can use the `db_setup.py` utility:

```bash
python db_setup.py
```

This will delete the existing database and create a fresh one with the latest schema. This is rarely needed during normal operation.

#### Command Line Options

The application supports several command-line options:

- `--verbose`, `-v`: Enable verbose logging
- `--process-file FILE`: Process a single PDF file without launching the GUI
- `--process-folder FOLDER`: Process all PDF files in a folder without launching the GUI
- `--search TERM`: Search for a term in the database without launching the GUI
- `--max-workers N`: Maximum number of worker threads for batch processing (default: 5)

##### Examples:

1. Launch the GUI with verbose logging:
   ```bash
   python run_pdf_search.py --verbose
   ```

2. Process a single PDF file from the command line:
   ```bash
   python run_pdf_search.py --process-file path/to/document.pdf
   ```

3. Process a folder of PDF files:
   ```bash
   python run_pdf_search.py --process-folder path/to/folder
   ```

4. Search the database from the command line:
   ```bash
   python run_pdf_search.py --search "search term"
   ```

#### Using the Python Module

You can also run the application as a Python module:

```bash
python -m pdf_search_plus.main
```

### Application Workflow

1. **Processing PDF Files**:
   - Click "Process PDF" in the main window
   - Choose between single file or folder (batch) processing
   - Select the PDF file or folder to process
   - Wait for the processing to complete

2. **Searching for Text**:
   - Click "Search PDFs" in the main window
   - Enter a search term in the context field
   - Toggle "Use Full-Text Search" option for faster searches on large collections
   - Click "Search"
   - View the results showing PDF file name, page number, and matching context
   - Use pagination controls to navigate through large result sets

3. **Previewing PDF Pages**:
   - Select a search result
   - Click "Preview PDF"
   - Use the navigation buttons to move between pages
   - Use the zoom buttons to adjust the view

## Database Schema

The application stores PDF data in an SQLite database called `pdf_data.db` with the following structure:

### Tables

- **pdf_files**: Stores metadata for each processed PDF file
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `file_name`: Name of the PDF file
  - `file_path`: Path to the PDF file
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when the record was created
  - `last_accessed`: Timestamp when the record was last accessed

- **pages**: Stores text extracted from each PDF page
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `pdf_id`: Foreign key to pdf_files
  - `page_number`: Page number
  - `text`: Extracted text

- **images**: Stores metadata about extracted images from the PDF
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `pdf_id`: Foreign key to pdf_files
  - `page_number`: Page number
  - `image_name`: Name of the image
  - `image_ext`: Image extension

- **ocr_text**: Stores the text extracted via OCR from images
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `pdf_id`: Foreign key to pdf_files
