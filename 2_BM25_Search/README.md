# PDF Knowledge Base Builder and Search Interface

This repository provides a suite of Python scripts to create a searchable knowledge base from PDF files, enabling efficient and intuitive text search with or without embeddings. The primary focus is simplicity and portability, avoiding the need for a formal database while offering advanced search capabilities.

## News
- Fixed crop issues with the PDF view and highlighting issues. Added a new search mode: BM25 substring. This method uses BM25 but can search substrings (try it by searching for the base form of a word, e.g. "compar" matches "compare" and "comparison"). Also, this mode has the "-" operator, so the user can remove terms from the search. For example, you can search for "machine transformers -autobot". (May 4, 2025)
- Automatic detection of platform (Linux or Windows) to set the default PDF viewer (Okular in Linux and Acrobat Reader in Windows). (March 9, 2025)
- Added option in the main application `BM25-String-Embed-Rerank-PDF-Search.py` to toggle cropping the PDF view. Some PDF files crop incorrectly, so this option gives the user the capability viewing the uncropped PDF view for problematic PDFs. (March 4, 2025)
- Graphical application to process folders in batches, `create-JSON-EMB.py`, now has a toggle for processing files in batches (uses more memory. If the script crashes disable this option). Also added an option to make the use of the Fastembed library optional (if the Fastembed library is not installed, the option to create EMB files will be disabled). (March 4, 2025)
- Now the creation of the database (JSON and EMB) files is easier! New graphical application to process folders in batches `create-JSON-EMB.py`. Binaries for this new script soon!. (February 2, 2025)
- Windows and Linux binaries updated (January 22, 2025)
- Fixed critical bug that kept the script `BM25-String-Embed-Rerank-PDF-Search.py` from running. Updated binaries soon (January 17, 2025)
- Windows and Linux binaries are available now! Please see the [Releases](https://github.com/Topping1/BM25-PDF-Search/releases) section.
- Now the user can specify and manage which folders to load at runtime. List of folders is saved in the file `folders.ini`

## Features
- Quickly search through a library of PDF files with an intuitive interface.
- Easily navigate and visualize search results using the built-in GUI.
- Allows opening search results in an external PDF viewer (Okular by default).
- Extracts text from PDFs and saves them as JSON files.
- Supports embedding generation for enhanced search capabilities.
- Optional integration with the `fastembed` library for embedding-based search.
- Tested in Linux and Windows 10

## Installation

### Requirements
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pymupdf4llm
pip install PyQt5
pip install bm25s
```

#### Optional Libraries
To enable embedding-based search:
```bash
pip install fastembed
```

**Pros of using `fastembed`:**
- Enables embedding-based search for semantic relevance.
- Supports reranking with embeddings.

**Cons if `fastembed` is not installed:**
- Only BM25 and simple text search methods are available.

#### External Dependency
The script assumes the **Okular PDF viewer** is installed on your system. If not, install it using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install okular` on Ubuntu).

---

## Workflow

### 1. Minimum Workflow (JSON files only)
- Run `create-JSON-EMB.py` to extract text from PDFs into JSON files. This is usually a long process but it needs to be done only once. Use the "Add Folders" button to add folders with PDF files to the queue. Uncheck the checkboxes from the "Process EMB" column. Press the "Start Processing" button to start the JSON and EMB creation.
- Use the `BM25-String-Embed-Rerank-PDF-Search.py` script to search the JSON files using BM25 or simple text search.

### 2. Recommended Workflow (JSON + EMB files)
- Run `create-JSON-EMB.py` to create JSON files from PDFs. This is usually a long process but it needs to be done only once. Use the "Add Folders" button to add folders with PDF files to the queue. Make sure that the checkboxes from the "Process JSON" and "Process EMB" columns are checked. Press the "Start Processing" button to start the JSON and EMB creation.
- Use `BM25-String-Embed-Rerank-PDF-Search.py` for full search functionality, including embedding-based search and reranking.

## Scripts Overview

### `create-JSON-EMB.py`
- Extracts text from PDF files into JSON format, chunked by pages.
- Outputs one JSON file per PDF, named after the original PDF.
- Generates embeddings for the text in JSON files using `fastembed`.
- Produces `.emb` files corresponding to the JSON files. These contain embeddings but exclude text for reduced size.
- The script checks for already processed PDFs, so if the user adds more PDFs to a folder, running the script again will only add the missing JSON files.
- The script checks for already processed JSON files, so if the user adds more PDFs and processes them into JSON files, running the script again will only add the missing EMB files.

### `count tokens-words.py` (not required for the workflow)
- Analyzes JSON files to calculate statistics like word count, token count, and token distribution.
- Outputs summaries and ASCII histograms for insights into document structure.

### `BM25-String-Embed-Rerank-PDF-Search.py`
- Main GUI application for searching the knowledge base.
- Supports BM25, simple text search, and embedding-based search (if EMB files are available and `fastembed` is installed).
- Allows opening search result pages in the external PDF viewer for easier browsing.

## GUI Usage

### Components
1. **Search Input Box**: Type your search keywords here. Press `Enter` to execute the search.
2. **Text Results Box**: Displays the most relevant text, including:
   - Filename
   - Page number
   - Relevance score
3. **PDF Viewer**: Displays the corresponding PDF page with highlighted keywords.
4. **Dropdown Boxes**:
   - **Search Method**: Select one of the following methods:
     - **BM25**: Default search using BM25.
     - **Simple Text Search**: Searches for exact keywords and phrases.
     - **Embeddings Search**: Uses semantic search based on embeddings (requires `fastembed` and EMB files).
   - **Reranking Method**: Options include:
     - No Reranking
     - Minimal Span-Based Scoring
     - Exact Text Search
     - Embeddings Rerank (requires `fastembed`)
   - **Behavior**: 
     - When **Simple Text Search** or **Embeddings Search** is selected, the reranking options are disabled.
     - When **BM25** is selected, reranking options are enabled.
5. **Navigation Buttons**:
   - `<--` and `-->`: Navigate between search results.
   - `+` and `-`: Adjust text font size.
   - `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-`, `Ctrl+0`: Zoom in, zoom out, or reset zoom for the PDF viewer.

### PDF Viewer Integration
- **Click Behavior**: Clicking on the PDF view within the GUI will open the currently displayed page in the external PDF viewer (Okular by default).
- **Configuring the PDF Viewer**:
  1. Open `BM25-String-Embed-Rerank-PDF-Search.py` in a text editor.
  2. Locate the following section:
     ```python
     subprocess.run(["okular", self.current_pdf_path, "-p", str(self.current_page)])
     ```
  3. Replace `"okular"` with the command for your preferred PDF viewer. For example:
     - **Evince**: `["evince", "--page-label=" + str(self.current_page), self.current_pdf_path]`
     - **Adobe Reader**: `["acrord32", "/A", "page=" + str(self.current_page), self.current_pdf_path]`
     - **Foxit Reader**: `["foxitreader", "-page", str(self.current_page), self.current_pdf_path]`
  4. Save the file.

**Note**: Different PDF viewers may have varying command-line options for specifying the page to open. Consult the documentation for your preferred viewer for the correct syntax.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Enter`: Perform a search.
- `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right`: Navigate results.
- `PageUp` / `PageDown`: Navigate through PDF pages in the viewer.
- `Ctrl+Left`, `Ctrl+Right`, `Ctrl+Up`, `Ctrl+Down`: Scroll the PDF view.
- `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-`, `Ctrl+0`: Adjust PDF zoom.

## Tips
- Organize your PDFs in folders and keep separate JSON and EMB files for each folder.
- For best performance, use `fastembed` to enable embedding-based searches and reranking.
- If the `create-JSON-EMB.py` script freezes while processing PDFs, optimize or recreate the problematic PDFs.

---

## Notes
- There is a delay when the application starts as it downloads the embedding model. This happens only once. Subsequent runs will not have this delay.
- This delay also happens when using the BM25 search method with the Embedding type reranking. This happens only once. Subsequent runs will not have this delay.
- There is also a delay when loading the PDF library at the application start. This depends on the size of the PDF library.
- Searching with BM25 search with Embedding type reranking has a delay that depends on the number of search hits, as the application has to create embeddings for all the search hits after pressing Enter to submit the query.

## Example
1. Place PDFs in a folder.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python create-JSON-EMB.py
   python BM25-String-Embed-Rerank-PDF-Search.py
   ```
3. Use the GUI to search your knowledge base.
